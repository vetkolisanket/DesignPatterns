# Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns

* [Factory Pattern](/src/creational/factory)
* [Abstract Factory Pattern](/src/creational/abstract_factory)
* [Singleton Pattern](/src/creational/singleton)

### Behavioral Patterns

* [Command Pattern](/src/behavioral/command)
* [Mediator Pattern](/src/behavioral/mediator)
* [Observer Pattern](/src/behavioral/observer)
* [Strategy Pattern](/src/behavioral/strategy)
* [Chain Of Responsibility Pattern](/src/behavioral/chain_of_responsibility)
* [State Pattern](/src/behavioral/state)

### Structural Patterns

* [Adapter Pattern](/src/structural/adapter)

Adapter pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.
This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to join functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces. A real life example could be a case of card reader which acts as an adapter between memory card and a laptop. You plugin the memory card into card reader and card reader into the laptop so that memory card can be read via laptop.
